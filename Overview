Hibernate is a framework for persisting/saving java objects in a database.
It provides object to relational mapping
Hibernate uses JDBC for all database communications
Hibernate sets another layer of abstraction on JDBC

Development process 
1.Add Hibernate config file (tells hibernate how to connect to Database)
2.Annotate Java Class
3.Develope java code to perform db operations

Dialect in Hibernate â€“ Dialect is a class and a bridge between Java JDBC types and SQL types, 
  which contains mapping between java language data type and database datatype. 
  Dialect allows Hibernate to generate SQL optimized for a particular relational database.
  Hibernate generates queries for the specific database based on the Dialect class.
  Use following property to set mySql dialect..e.g mysql
          <property name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>
